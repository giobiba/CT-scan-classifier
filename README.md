# CT-scan-classifier
The final project for my Machine Learning Class, in which I had to classify ct scans of lungs. The details to this for this can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ai-unibuc-23-31-2021). I achieved an accuracy of almost 73% by creating a convolutional neural network in tensorflow.
